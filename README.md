# Sushi Quest: A Ninja's Journey

Welcome to Sushi Quest, a thrilling adventure game where you play as a skilled ninja on a mission to create the ultimate sushi. In this enchanted world, you will face various challenges and enemies, including other ninjas, vikings, and gorillas, as you collect sushi ingredients and strive to assemble the perfect sushi.

The game features a combination of combat and platformer gameplay, with three difficulty modes to choose from. You can customize your ninja's appearance and name, and progress through levels by collecting ingredients such as rice, seaweed, fish, veggies, and sauce. Along the way, you will interact with wise NPCs who will offer hints and humor to aid you.

In each level, you will face unique challenges and enemies, such as combat against ninjas and vikings, or a platformer level where you must fight enemy star-throwing ninjas. Your ninja will have a powerful punch and can power up and level up throughout the game.
